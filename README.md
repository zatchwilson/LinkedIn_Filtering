<div align="center">
    <h1>LinkedIn Job Search Blocker</h1>
    <h3>An easy way to hide unwanted LinkedIn job postings.</h3>
</div>

This extension uses simple JS to read the contents of the LinkedIn search page and hide job postings from unwanted companies or agencies.

To use, simply install and enter in any keywords you would like to filter. In my experience, this is most helpful for job agencies or services that will post jobs from their own job-search site on LinkedIn.
